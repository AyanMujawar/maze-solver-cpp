# MAZE SOLVER IN C++

A simple C++ program that solves a maze using **BFS (Breadth First Search)** and **DFS (Depth First Search)** algorithms.

## 📌 Features
- Takes custom maze input from the user
- Allows setting start and goal positions
- Solves using both BFS and DFS
- Displays success/failure messages 

## 🧩 Maze Format
- Maze is a 2D grid of `1`s (open path) and `0`s (blocked)
- Example input for a 5x5 maze:
1 1 1 0 0
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 1

✨ Demo

Enter starting point (x, y) : 0 0  
Enter goal (x, y) : 4 4  
Maze Input:  
<Enter your maze row by row>

Menu:  
1. Print the maze  
2. Solve the maze using BFS  
3. Solve the maze using DFS  
4. Exit
